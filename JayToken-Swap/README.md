# JoyToken Contract
**Welcome to the JoyToken Project repository**, a Flow blockchain initiative designed to bring joy through custom JoyTokens. Dive into our diverse functionalities, implemented through a carefully structured codebase, transactions, and scripts for managing joy tokens. This repository is thoughtfully divided into several parts, each addressing specific aspects of joyful token management and interactions.



### Overview

The heart of our project, the `JoyToken` contract, is the epicenter of joy token management. Explore its key features:

-  The contract owner's power to mint new joy tokens.
-  Securely stored balances within the `Vault` resource.
-   Dive into various transactions and scripts enabling joy token control.



### Transactions

1. Properly sets up a vault within a user's account storage.
2. Mint joy tokens for a specified recipient.
3. Empowers users to transfer joy tokens to different addresses.
4. Allows the Admin to withdraw joy tokens and deposit $FLOW tokens.

### Scripts

1. Checks if a user's vault is set up correctly.
2. Retrieves the balance of a user's vault.
3. Reports the total supply of joy tokens in circulation.
4. Returns the balance of the user's $FLOW vault and joy vault.
5. Provides a structured summary of all official JoyToken vaults in the user's account storage.


### Swapping Functionality

The `Swap` contract enables users to deposit $FLOW tokens and receive joy tokens in return. The received amount is based on the time since their last swap.


Two methods ensure user identity and authenticity:

1.  Custom identity resource to represent identity.
2.  Reference to the user's $FLOW vault to verify authenticity.

## Conclusion

The JoyToken project is a celebration of custom JoyToken, encapsulating joy in every transaction. This repository organizes code and functionalities into distinct parts for a more comprehensible and manageable experience.

For comprehensive usage and instructions, please refer to the individual code files and comments within the repository. May joy accompany every step of your JoyToken journey!


## Happy New Year
